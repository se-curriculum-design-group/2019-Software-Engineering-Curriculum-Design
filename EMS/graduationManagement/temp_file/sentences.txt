as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a you wont scratch your screens / keys b you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys

another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on

for me that was the only drawback

when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 1 0

with nikon although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras i 've had the following headaches

most of our emplyees use this model phone

other tagging problems result i think from the nomad 's operating system

at least once youve got focus lock the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second which from what ive read is better than just about anything else available

i wish i could give negative stars

an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 3 
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue

for a specific location i still think its a great phone 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing

the battery life on this phone is surreal

at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software and can t praise it highly enough

no voice activated dialing what were they thinking

obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode

this is all i have to say

i dare you to surf the net and find the code

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality and then if you want fantasy you can use photoshop to create it

0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 
still had to send it back to nikon for repair 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty

the movie mode is also working great 
0 1 2 0 0 0 3

to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year

the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to

they are all free if you get a new account anyway but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling

weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting 2x 3x 4x 1/2x etc. before getting back to normal size -lsb- sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly -rsb-

and finally get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness

5 -rrb- the cheap user-replaceable battery $ 50 from creative is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace

while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it

if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff but that little work will save you looking for songs

the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates

i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player

i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 
the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist track name and album name 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb it does not on the zen nx

the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to

0 1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand

my recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003

you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of now playing interface you can see the interface as modern or classical

the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it

i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99

anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net being able to download pics and ringtones not java apps you need t-zones for that

for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience

this is not a player you can take jogging 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

the good news is if you can t get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it

the other day when i was listening to a song it locked up and will not do anything now

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
if you want to listen to tunes while you travel i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing including audio books

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies

0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 
buyer beware sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly maybe this applies to other players too and not just the nomad i do n't know

this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos red-eye and annoying shadows a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing almost-natural lighting

the entire unit was poorly crafted

the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me and it was only a few dollars more

price along with the replaceable battery which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace as well as the hassle of returning it were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad

now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf which gives me 130 raw images as opposed to 7

the inside pics can be a bit challenging but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like that are not focused perfectly or need lighting adjustments make this camera very simple and effective

after having bought and been disappointed in another brand of dvd player i purchased the apex ad2600 from amazon and first of all i should say it was delivered much more quickly than i had expected

spend the extra 20 $ and buy a name brand dvd player

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 
it only comes in 20gb enough for most people not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates

i chose the canon speedlite 420

the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger now-blue backlit screen which is infinitely better

0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones

0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

first let me give you the bad things

this includes the $ 20 that you have to pay up front just to get them to look at your player

if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 
so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them

2 music organization is based on id3 by genre artist album etc. and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information

the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3

the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do

finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store which if you ever plan to pay for your music is by far the best

to address two previous somewhat negative reviews 1 yes the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder however the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder

if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk it will not copy both it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second

if you want great sound quality do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount then i would suggest the zen xtra for you

this is the best phone i have seen

buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time probably sooner than later

it 's probably good for the health of your ears however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range and my hearing is fine

yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom when you zoom the lens distortion goes away canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture

for prospective buyers i would warn of the following 1 purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable this applies to earbuds in general and 2 make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves

the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance picture quality and battery life which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera

i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash

again you can change this but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you

there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious a little larger than other mp3s but still light the software takes some time to get used to maybe 10-15 mins and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall

i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 in conjunction with my professional flash system and can easily put up with the cameras limitations because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits

with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority for high speed subjects aperture priority for focal length or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality

since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod

the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash and most of the time the exposure is spot on and when it isnt its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself

i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer while my office bars the addition of any non-work software it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive

a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want while these digital cameras my friends now inform me all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture

the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls especially the scroll wheel

if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal ruggedly constructed fault proof good product support easy to use software then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet

the music is easy to get to all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say and if you know how to search for an artist by name online then you can do the same with the zen

the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models

one thing before buying this player i have called the creative tech support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes

my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes and i 'm getting the those 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter at lensmateonline.com

want the laundry list of reasons why 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub-par

0 1 2 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 3 
you got to have flash on to get it eventhough your room is well lit

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 
you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to instead of just connecting it with a usb connection

i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead

possibly the biggest advantage this player has if price was n't enough is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery

1 buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive

since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure the duplicate name problem stems from the actual file name not from the song 's title / artist / album

the volume key can be hard to press but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call

on the subject of headphones this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof

the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used

duplicates are a no brainer and cheap

it has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents however enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can t be used

a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album artist song title etc.

i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection whihc is a plus but then again it is only speculation

the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera

the cons are n't really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and it 's based on the title of the songs many of my songs where seperated into folders on the pc and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another

whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox it dumps all of them into a single folder and then sorts them by the id3 tags

in that too there is n't a direct way to add date time you got to say print images to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date time

recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately

just a little overview powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera its 4 megapixel and alsmost full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance

the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on the camera wo n't fit in the small cases and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find

if you hold down the scroll wheel too long which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through it will get stuck rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it

it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory smaller / lighter and the 30gb uses a hard drive

4mp 4x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras easy to understand and use has a great swivel lcd screen a lot of features and add-on options comes with great software not to be overlooked and last but by far not least received my fiance 's stamp of approval two thumbs up

finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order

as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a you wont scratch your screens / keys b you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys

another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on

for me that was the only drawback 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing

the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly dangerous when you 're driving at night and there 's no way to change this

with nikon although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras i 've had the following headaches

this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time

it worked good for a while

most of our emplyees use this model phone

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
other tagging problems result i think from the nomad 's operating system

at least once youve got focus lock the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second which from what ive read is better than just about anything else available

because other people that complain about this player are talking bull this player is awesome it just breaks fast which is horrible

i wish i could give negative stars

an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 4 
the screen may be a little smaller but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue

for a specific location i still think its a great phone 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 
it gives great pictures the controls are easy to use the battery lasts forever on one single charge the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing

the battery life on this phone is surreal

at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software and can t praise it highly enough

no voice activated dialing what were they thinking 
0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0

obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode

this is all i have to say

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3

what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality and then if you want fantasy you can use photoshop to create it

still had to send it back to nikon for repair 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty

the movie mode is also working great 
0 1 2 0 0 0 3

to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year

the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to

2 most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous

they are all free if you get a new account anyway but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling

weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting 2x 3x 4x 1/2x etc. before getting back to normal size -lsb- sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly -rsb-

the included eax support is useful at times especially when you listen to a variety of genres as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle

5 -rrb- the cheap user-replaceable battery $ 50 from creative is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace

while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it

if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff but that little work will save you looking for songs

the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates

i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 
the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist track name and album name

anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net being able to download pics and ringtones not java apps you need t-zones for that

if you want to listen to tunes while you travel i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing including audio books

buyer beware sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly maybe this applies to other players too and not just the nomad i do n't know

this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos red-eye and annoying shadows a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing almost-natural lighting

the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me and it was only a few dollars more

now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf which gives me 130 raw images as opposed to 7

8 perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out the g3 has much sharper white offsets

the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do

finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store which if you ever plan to pay for your music is by far the best

if you want great sound quality do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount then i would suggest the zen xtra for you

buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time probably sooner than later

yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom when you zoom the lens distortion goes away canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture

the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance picture quality and battery life which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera

the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash and most of the time the exposure is spot on and when it isnt its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself

a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want while these digital cameras my friends now inform me all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture

the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub-par

you got to have flash on to get it eventhough your room is well lit

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 
you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to instead of just connecting it with a usb connection

i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead

possibly the biggest advantage this player has if price was n't enough is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery

the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device even with third party software that creates folders documents and programs can t be launched from the zen so it is not a hard disk it 's a storage device at best

the volume key can be hard to press but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call

on the subject of headphones this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof

there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open my prev machine did it automatically and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance

a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album artist song title etc.

in other words to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it

the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera

the cons are n't really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and it 's based on the title of the songs many of my songs where seperated into folders on the pc and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another

recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately

just a little overview powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera its 4 megapixel and alsmost full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance

the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on the camera wo n't fit in the small cases and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find

if you hold down the scroll wheel too long which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through it will get stuck rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

4mp 4x optical zoom takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras easy to understand and use has a great swivel lcd screen a lot of features and add-on options comes with great software not to be overlooked and last but by far not least received my fiance 's stamp of approval two thumbs up

none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers you can not make changes on the ipod that are premanent

overall i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too

it 's easy to use and yet very feature rich

finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order

you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country

as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a you wont scratch your screens / keys b you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys

another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on 
0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
for me that was the only drawback 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing

i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class

the downside

2 most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous

ensure you get a larger flash 128 or 256 some are selling with the larger flash 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras

they are all free if you get a new account anyway but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling

weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting 2x 3x 4x 1/2x etc. before getting back to normal size -lsb- sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly -rsb-

and finally get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness

while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it

very easy to use

you can also search for your song which is good

the environmental audio however is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates

a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names

looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it

also the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display so even though the side controls are reachable i have to open it up to see the display

i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player

i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 
the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist track name and album name 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
i have read a lot of the reviews and my phone does not have a hiss or anything that people are talking about

if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb it does not on the zen nx 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to

0 1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 
as it stands now the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel or if you load up all your songs beforehand

my recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003

the front cover which you remove to take out the battery feels flimsy but when snapped on the device still feels pretty solid

the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful and expensive canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography

i have not yet tried the photo show capability but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too based on the success with the above mentioned disks

for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience

this is not a player you can take jogging

the good news is if you can t get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it

so far the player froze on me once i started pushing buttons before it loaded but since is hard drive based you have to expect that

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
if you want to listen to tunes while you travel i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing including audio books

it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies

0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 2 
buyer beware sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly maybe this applies to other players too and not just the nomad i do n't know

this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos red-eye and annoying shadows a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing almost-natural lighting

you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre no other division

the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's or as sexy looking

the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me and it was only a few dollars more

price along with the replaceable battery which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace as well as the hassle of returning it were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad

but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera

one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder but does not detract from the image at all

in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use small good for travel and provides excellent sharp images

now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf which gives me 130 raw images as opposed to 7

yes the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe

8 perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out the g3 has much sharper white offsets

the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do

any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support

finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store which if you ever plan to pay for your music is by far the best

the battery lasts very long when playing music but writing files to the player drains the battery fast so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files

this is the best phone i have seen

0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 
so i recomend it but not for those that have any hearing troubles or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places which is annoying by the way

buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time probably sooner than later

it 's probably good for the health of your ears however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range and my hearing is fine

yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom when you zoom the lens distortion goes away canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture

for prospective buyers i would warn of the following 1 purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable this applies to earbuds in general and 2 make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves

the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance picture quality and battery life which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera

0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 
i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed and will not hold up to normal use

a the picture quality color and sharpness of focusing are so great it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging how could one eat rice one grain at a time

also you can store data on it which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod do n't bother this is a much better buy

i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash

again you can change this but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you

do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
go out and get a 256meg card it 's worth the expense

one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand but with my experience and reading the other reviews i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product

i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s and it 's a lot nicer to access them 4.5 gb at a time dvd-r than 0.7 gb at a time cd-r

i will say this

it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work because it works on all the other computers i have

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 
just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done

what a mistake

i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk by accident as well as have played it outdoors in 30 fahrenheit weather by design and it has continued to work fine

however the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off

a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want while these digital cameras my friends now inform me all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture

the music is easy to get to all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say and if you know how to search for an artist by name online then you can do the same with the zen

the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models

want the laundry list of reasons why

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub-par

0 1 2 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 3 
you got to have flash on to get it eventhough your room is well lit

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 
you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to instead of just connecting it with a usb connection

i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead

possibly the biggest advantage this player has if price was n't enough is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery

1 buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive

on the subject of headphones this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof

a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album artist song title etc.

if you do n't have tags it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders

in other words to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it

m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp but not creative without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music creative or any other company all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags hooray

the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera

the cons are n't really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and it 's based on the title of the songs many of my songs where seperated into folders on the pc and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another

whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox it dumps all of them into a single folder and then sorts them by the id3 tags

recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately

just a little overview powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera its 4 megapixel and alsmost full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance

the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on the camera wo n't fit in the small cases and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find

if you hold down the scroll wheel too long which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through it will get stuck rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it

playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists

it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long especially if you use the flash a lot

0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 
it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory smaller / lighter and the 30gb uses a hard drive

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions even if they did n't to which they always seem to expect a yes answer from you

when plugged in it does n't lag the computer like the archos did unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load

none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers you can not make changes on the ipod that are premanent

overall i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too

once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player

it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims

i finally decided to upgrade and started my research 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
it 's easy to use and yet very feature rich 
0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 3 
0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 3 
do n't buy this player 
0 0 0 0 1 
0 0 0 0 0 
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order 
0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
i can t fit all that resolution 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol in my 19in flat monitor 1200x1024 resol anyways

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 
you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a you wont scratch your screens / keys b you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on 
0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
for me that was the only drawback 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 
this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class 
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

3 the nomad explorer winxp style interface works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player

my one issue with the mediasource software is that despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service the ripping process fails to populate the year field

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 
you need the software to actually transfer files

* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window 
0 0 1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing

ensure you get a larger flash 128 or 256 some are selling with the larger flash 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras

they are all free if you get a new account anyway but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling

weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting 2x 3x 4x 1/2x etc. before getting back to normal size -lsb- sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly -rsb-

without any tweaking at all if the exposure is accurate the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film and this is a raw image

its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists phone numbers address books ect like the ipod which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device

while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it

i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player

i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 
the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist track name and album name

the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive

what can i say i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever quality design stable plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies

anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net being able to download pics and ringtones not java apps you need t-zones for that

if you want to listen to tunes while you travel i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing including audio books

this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos red-eye and annoying shadows a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing almost-natural lighting

the entire unit was poorly crafted 
0 0 1 0 3 1 
0 0 0 0 3 4 
the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me and it was only a few dollars more

price along with the replaceable battery which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace as well as the hassle of returning it were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad

one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder but does not detract from the image at all

in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use small good for travel and provides excellent sharp images

now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf which gives me 130 raw images as opposed to 7

creative is talking about updating it via firmware however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates not too much of new features

this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags

try before you buy if at all possible although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface

my advice to mp3 buyers consider how much storage space you will need then try and listen before you buy mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them

it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice

if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it

yes the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe

8 perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out the g3 has much sharper white offsets

after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive so better organization is required

now i use ms mediaplayer musicmatch free downladed and explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player to replace the mediasource

the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files through mediasource but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files

i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera

the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do

any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support

4 a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio home receiver etc.

this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive

finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store which if you ever plan to pay for your music is by far the best

the battery lasts very long when playing music but writing files to the player drains the battery fast so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files

if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk it will not copy both it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second

it was easy enough to remove the front plate and there was only one way the battery could be inserted

yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom when you zoom the lens distortion goes away canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture

i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year no questions asked replacement warranty will be worth it since creative will only warrant it for 90 days which in itself is totally ridiculous

for prospective buyers i would warn of the following 1 purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable this applies to earbuds in general and 2 make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves

the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance picture quality and battery life which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera

i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash

again you can change this but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you

i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand but with my experience and reading the other reviews i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product

a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want while these digital cameras my friends now inform me all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture

if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal ruggedly constructed fault proof good product support easy to use software then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet

the music is easy to get to all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say and if you know how to search for an artist by name online then you can do the same with the zen

the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models

want the laundry list of reasons why 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub-par

0 1 2 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 3 
you got to have flash on to get it eventhough your room is well lit

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 
you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to instead of just connecting it with a usb connection

i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead

possibly the biggest advantage this player has if price was n't enough is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery

1 buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive

on the subject of headphones this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof

4 the zen * stores * data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched

so buy the g3

a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album artist song title etc.

from there you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player with the help of the media sniffer read the manual

all in all trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift

the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera

the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy and has an awkward tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera

the cons are n't really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and it 's based on the title of the songs many of my songs where seperated into folders on the pc and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another

whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox it dumps all of them into a single folder and then sorts them by the id3 tags

in that too there is n't a direct way to add date time you got to say print images to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date time

it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes

the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings

recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately

just a little overview powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera its 4 megapixel and alsmost full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance

the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on the camera wo n't fit in the small cases and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find

if you hold down the scroll wheel too long which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through it will get stuck rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it

playlists can be made on the fly without aid of a computer and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your now playing selections or playlists

it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long especially if you use the flash a lot

0 0 0 0 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory smaller / lighter and the 30gb uses a hard drive

mixed bag i guess but the price was right

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 3 4 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 1 
so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions even if they did n't to which they always seem to expect a yes answer from you

it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 
when plugged in it does n't lag the computer like the archos did unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers you can not make changes on the ipod that are premanent

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 
overall i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack hissing or scroll wheel problems show up with me too

once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player

sound quality was the same between the two but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features

the dvd player does not work properly

6 the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge it does not charge by usb cable this is not tragic but usb recharging would be a convenient additional choice

learning how to use it will not take very long 
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3

it looks really sleek and stylish and does everything it claims

save your cash go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation

i finally decided to upgrade and started my research 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
it 's easy to use and yet very feature rich 
0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 3 
0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 3 
do n't buy this player 
0 0 0 0 1 
0 0 0 0 0 
finally making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually and are organized by cd which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order 
0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can t 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
i can t fit all that resolution 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol in my 19in flat monitor 1200x1024 resol anyways 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 
you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a you wont scratch your screens / keys b you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on 
0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
for me that was the only drawback 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 
when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 
but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class 
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

you need the software to actually transfer files

so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing

everyone who says i can t buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies

ensure you get a larger flash 128 or 256 some are selling with the larger flash 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras

they are all free if you get a new account anyway but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling

weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting 2x 3x 4x 1/2x etc. before getting back to normal size -lsb- sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly -rsb-

while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it

i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player

the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can t get an accurate adjustment for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight

what can i say i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever quality design stable plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies

anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net being able to download pics and ringtones not java apps you need t-zones for that

this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos red-eye and annoying shadows a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing almost-natural lighting

0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 3 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 
the entire unit was poorly crafted 
0 0 1 0 3 1 
0 0 0 0 3 4 
the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me and it was only a few dollars more

nikon 4300 i feel is the best camera out there for the features and price

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 
now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1

maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures

0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 
it is small 
0 0 0 
0 0 3 
but i would expect that since my movie discs have all played with no problem the extras discs would too without any additional tweaking

however i should have followed my instincts 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

it plays all my back-ups + or and everything else i have put in it without a hick up

price along with the replaceable battery which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace as well as the hassle of returning it were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad

amazon was supposed to send me another one but did n't and sent me a gift certificate instead i 'm guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since december

one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder but does not detract from the image at all

creative is talking about updating it via firmware however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates not too much of new features

this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags

i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category

try before you buy if at all possible although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface

my advice to mp3 buyers consider how much storage space you will need then try and listen before you buy mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them

yes the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe

it is small overall bigger than the ipod but keep in mind that this is because different less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx

the phone has a few minor inconveniences but only because it lacks those features bluetooth and high spend internet but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do

any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support

finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store which if you ever plan to pay for your music is by far the best

the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources you can t do this on the ipod except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player

moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon

if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk it will not copy both it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second

if you want great sound quality do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount then i would suggest the zen xtra for you

buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time probably sooner than later

yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom when you zoom the lens distortion goes away canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lmost exactly ot the picture

you see i can t rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with j and r camera to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product

creative also sells batteries via its website so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery

so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack

i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed and will not hold up to normal use

i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash

again you can change this but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you

i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand but with my experience and reading the other reviews i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product

i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s and it 's a lot nicer to access them 4.5 gb at a time dvd-r than 0.7 gb at a time cd-r

the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls especially the scroll wheel

if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal ruggedly constructed fault proof good product support easy to use software then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet

the music is easy to get to all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say and if you know how to search for an artist by name online then you can do the same with the zen

the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models

want the laundry list of reasons why

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating and the interface with the player is sub-par

0 1 2 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 3 
you got to have flash on to get it eventhough your room is well lit

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 
you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to instead of just connecting it with a usb connection

i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead

possibly the biggest advantage this player has if price was n't enough is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery

1 buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive

on the subject of headphones this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof

4 the zen * stores * data files but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched

despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually

i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 but at the camera shop realized this one went above and beyond

both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback while the counter on the player kept going

overall this player is awesome and i definately recommend it

since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make

even if it has n't expired creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty

a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album artist song title etc.

if you do n't have tags it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders

in other words to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it

from there you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player with the help of the media sniffer read the manual

all in all trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift

the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera

the cons are n't really a big deal to me except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files no folder structure and it 's based on the title of the songs many of my songs where seperated into folders on the pc and a few had same titles so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox it dumps all of them into a single folder and then sorts them by the id3 tags

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
in that too there is n't a direct way to add date time you got to say print images to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date time 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 
it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes

the zoom goes up and down in magnification which is nice but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings

10 -rrb- multiple play modes tracks in order of album shuffle etc. is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter

recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card as expected i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately

just a little overview powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera its 4 megapixel and alsmost full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance

the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on the camera wo n't fit in the small cases and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find

if you hold down the scroll wheel too long which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through it will get stuck rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it

it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long especially if you use the flash a lot

it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory smaller / lighter and the 30gb uses a hard drive
